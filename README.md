> The poor image is a copy in motion. Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard. As it accelerates, it deteriorates. It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed for free, squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels of distribution.

[**Image Explorer**](https://jwyg.github.io/image-explorer/) is a set of browser-based tools for the visual exploration of image collections.

It is inspired by recent work on [visual methods](https://www.zotero.org/groups/visual_methods) in the context of internet studies and new media research.

It is created using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and intended to work alongside other web-based tools and libraries for repurposing web and social media data such as those from the [Digital Methods Initiative](https://tools.digitalmethods.net/) and the [médialab, Sciences Po, Paris](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/).

# 🥞 Image Stack

Enables the creation of an "image stack" from a set of image URLs.

Follows from recent work on "composite images" (Pearce et al, 2018; Niederer & Colombo, 2019).
